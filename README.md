# Introducing Fastly Optimized!
The Ultimate Minecraft Optimization Modpack! Experience buttery smooth gameplay, lightning-fast loading times, and a performance boost that'll leave your game feeling like heaven! This modpack not only enhances performance but also includes shader support, zoom functionality, and connected textures! Upgrade from being a potato to a gaming powerhouse with Fastly Optimized and unleash the full potential of your Minecraft adventure.

# Why Fastly Optimized?
The goal of Fastly Optimized is to create a super easy way for people to increase their performance while providing just the most essential Optifine features. It cuts back on some of the clutter in other Optifine replacement packs that I believe most players will not use. I provide zip files for the mods and config files in this github page.

# Works anywhere
Fastly Optimized doesn't add any additional content to the game, allowing for compatibility with most any world or server.

# Support / Help

Get ready to optimize your Minecraft journey like never before with Fastly Optimized â€” prepare to be amazed!

# Installation
There are 2 versions of Fastly Optimized. One is for pcs, and the other is for Pojav Launcher.
## Pojav Launcher
You have to download 3 files. One is the version of Fastly Optimized, the second one is the Vulkan patcher and 3rd is the java 17 file.

But first you have to install MT Manager, link down below!

Open Pojav Launcher, login into your account, go into the settings, click java tweaks and then click runtime manager and click the jre 17 file. Then install a fabric version of Minecraft 1.20.1 . After installing it, open it, make it load and then close it.
